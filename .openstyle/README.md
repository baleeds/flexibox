## Synopsis

openStyle is an internal DB open source framework that contains reusable UI elements that are leveraged between different applications. This project is considered a **working** project and will continue to evolve and change as the demands increase.

## Code Example

### Button Styles

CSS
.button, button 
	

HTML
```
	<a class="report-selector button" href="#">
		Tab Selector Dropdown
		<i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i>
	</a>
```

## Motivation

When building out applications in the bank we commonly find that components (UI elements) within applications are consistently being recreated several times over and even when trying to have the same look and feel. Having a common toolkit or an internal framework in which developers can pull and reuse UI elements are the motivation behind this. 

## Installation

[We need to write these instructions up. To start include some css file.]
